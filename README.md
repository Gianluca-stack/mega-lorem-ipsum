# Technical Interview Question
## Mega-Lorem-Ipsum

### Some points
- In script.js, change the **ip_address** variable to your private IP address, whether you are using an **Ethernet Cable** or **WIFI**.
- After downloading and unzipping the zip file, open **Command Prompt** or **PowerShell** and type **cd mega-lorem-ipsum-tech_interview** and again **cd mega-lorem-ipsum-tech_interview** (Github when downloading a zip file stores the main folder into another with the same name). Then, run the server by typing **node server/server.js**. This will print out the **PORT number**.
- Once the server is running, you can access the website by typing the following URL in your browser: **http://your_private_ip_address:port_number/index.html**.
